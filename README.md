# Basic-Encypted-Messaging-app
We created this project with 3 friends to gain experience and have fun.

This project uses hole punching to create a connection between two clients.
If you want to use this program you need a server with a static ip and open port.

It creates connection between the pairs that connect. Meaning you have to connect in
successive order.

The encryption algorithm is RSA and by default the key lenght is 1024 bits.

After setting up the server with server.py you can run the aray√ºz.py and use the program.

The plain public and private key.txt files are for debugging purposes. You should not share your private key.
